In this post, I'll show you how to utilize the `plotly` and `pandas` packages to easily produce simple or complex data visualization figures!

### Read/Load in your Data

Before we actually do anything, we have to load in our designated dataset. In this example, I will be using the *Palmer Penguins* dataset. 

To begin, we can read in the data by running: 

```python
import pandas as pd
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/palmer_penguins.csv"
penguins = pd.read_csv(url)
```

### Clean and Configure the Data

Now that we have imported the `pandas` package and the dataset, we can do some quick tweaks to the entire dataset to make it a bit simpler. 

If we run the code block below:

```python
# drop the NA values within dataset
penguins = penguins.dropna(subset = ["Body Mass (g)", "Sex"])

# reduce/simplify species name
penguins["Species"] = penguins["Species"].str.split().str.get(0)

# remove penguins whose sex is labeled as "."
penguins = penguins[penguins["Sex"] != "."]

# select more relevant columns
cols = ["Species", "Island", "Sex", "Culmen Length (mm)", "Culmen Depth (mm)", "Flipper Length (mm)", "Body Mass (g)"]

# replace updated dataframe with selected columns
penguins = penguins[cols]
```

This will result in an updated and simplified dataframe that contains more relevant columns without unnecessary values like *NA*. Making figures will be much more simpler now!

### Making our Data Visualization Figure

Now, we are ready to create our figure. To do so, we are going to use the `plotly express` module from the `plotly` library and so, we need to import it first. 

```python
from plotly import express as px
```

For my data visualization figure, I will compare the penguin's body mass against its' culmen length in a scatterplot. There are many variations you can do, but I will use this as an example!

If we run the code block below:

```python
from plotly import express as px

figure = px.scatter(data_frame = penguins, 
                x = "Body Mass (g)",  # x-variable
                y = "Culmen Length (mm)",  # y-variable
                title = "Penguin Body Mass (g) against Culmen Length (mm)", # set title
                color = "Species", # separate by species
                width = 600, # set width
                height = 400, # set height
                opacity = 0.6)  # set transparency

figure.update_layout(margin = {"r": 75, "l": 75, "t":75, "b":75})

figure.show()
```
{% include mass_vs_culmenlength.html %}
