In this post, I'll show you how to utilize the `plotly` and `pandas` packages to easily produce simple or complex data visualization figures!

### Read/Load in your Data

Before we actually do anything, we have to load in our designated dataset. In this example, I will use the *Palmer Penguins* dataset. 

To begin, we can read in the data by running: 

```python
import pandas as pd
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/palmer_penguins.csv"
penguins = pd.read_csv(url)
